I was so honored to be invited to be the inaugural Class Day Speaker. But obviously since I’m a graduate of the University of Chicago, I couldn’t just accept the invitation I had to overanalyze it.

很荣幸能受邀来作毕业典礼演讲。但我是芝加哥大学毕业的，我不能简单地接受邀请，我还要过度分析一下这次邀请。

  

My first thought was that since this is Chicago it couldn’t just be class day; maybe it was class conflict day with special appearances by Marx and Engels and Race, Class and Gender day with Betty Friedan T-Shirts.

我首先想到的是，既然这是芝大，所以这肯定不是简单的开放日；也许这应该是阶级斗争开放日，有打扮成马克思和恩格斯的人出没，或者有穿着贝蒂·弗里丹的T-恤，庆祝种族、阶级、性别自由的学生。

  

Then I began wondering why the University of Chicago class is asking me of all people to be a speaker at this big event. I remembered the major addresses of my own time here and how intellectually rigorous they were.

然后我又开始想，为什么芝大偏偏请我来这个重要的场合当致辞嘉宾。我还记得我上学那时候的致辞嘉宾，他们个个严谨治学、富有洞见。

  

I remembered that Freshman year a noted philosopher gave an uplifting Aims of Education Address called “Death, Despair, Desolation and the Futility of Human Existence.”

我记得新生入学年，一位有名的哲学家发表了振奋人心的《教育宗旨》演讲，题为：“死亡、绝望、孤独以及人类存在的虚无”。

  

Then senior year at commencement our speaker was a noted biologist. I found myself tremendously inspired by his uplifting talk, “The Sixteen Qualities of Nucleic Acid.”

然后到了高年级的毕业典礼上，致辞嘉宾是位知名的生物学家。我发觉自己被他激情四射的演讲深深打动：《核酸的十六个特性》。

  

Eventually I realized that I am being invited because Chicago is trying to be like a normal school with a celebrity commencement speaker. But of course they couldn’t go for a big time celebrity right off the bat. Chicago is a place where you lose your virginity slowly.

最终我意识到，我之所以受邀，是因为芝大想努力地表现出，它是所“正常”的学校，有名人来做毕业典礼致辞嘉宾。当然，校方不能一下子就请一个大牌的明星。毕竟，在芝加哥就连失去自己的第一次都要很晚才实现。

  

For the first class day speaker, they wanted someone on TV, but only on PBS. Then, after everybody is acclimated to the outside speaker thing, they could go ahead and invite someone big.

因此，选开放日致辞嘉宾时，他们希望是在电视能看到的人，但是仅限PBS电台。当所有人都习惯了致辞嘉宾来自外界时，校方就可以请点大人物了。

That’s when the truth came to me. I am University of Chicago’s gateway drug to Stephen Colbert. You, the class of 2017 will have to suffer through me so that future classes can enjoy Matt Damon. That’s what I call living for something larger than self.

我就是这么领悟到了玄机。我呢，是芝大请来的“入门级”的扣扣熊（注：美国知名脱口秀主持人Stephen Colbert，被粉丝称为扣叔，扣扣熊等，以毒辣幽默的评论而为人称道。诱导性毒品可以是酒精、大麻等等，被认为是毒品的入门级。）。你们2017级的新生呢，要先过我这一关，然后才能在将来享受马特·达蒙（注：美国著名演员，代表组作《谍影重重》、《拯救大兵瑞恩》、《火星救援》等）。我管这叫做为了更大的目标而活着。

  

When I realized what was going on, I confess I was tempted to do what you millennials are always doing. I decided I would feel triggered and unsafe and lead a campaign to get myself disinvited. All the historical traumas of being a lower-middle range celebrity came down on me and I retreated to my safe space, which is under the bar at Jimmy’s.

当我意识到我为什么受邀时，我其实差点儿没忍住做了你们千禧年一代爱做的事。我得觉得自己受到高能预警，没有安全感，要发起一场运动，抵制这次自己的受邀。之前作为一名中低端名人的种种伤痛记忆都向我袭来，我退回了自己的安全区，就是吉米酒吧那里。（注：千禧年一代指在1981-2000年出生的人）

  

But since none of you did your generational duty and got me blocked from this gig, I’ve decided to go ahead.

但既然你们没有履行你们这一代的义务，像之前那样抵制致辞嘉宾，我决定继续说下去。

  

Since Chicago is new to this game I should note that there are certain traditions involved in these kinds of occasions.

既然芝加哥大学对于“正常”的毕业致辞还不熟悉，我需要指出在这种场合下一般有的传统元素。

  

At occasions like this major universities ask a person who has achieved a fantastic career success to give you a speech telling you that career success is not important.

像今天这个场合，知名大学会请一位功成名就知名人士来给你们致辞，告诉你们，成功并不重要。

  

At occasions like this major universities often ask billionaires to give speeches telling you how much you can learn from failure. From this you can take away the lesson that failure seems really great if you happen to be Steve Jobs or J.K. Rowling.

像今天这样，知名大学常常会邀请亿万富翁来致辞，告诉你们能从失败中学到什么。从这种讲话中将领略到失败是多么了不起的事情，当然，你得恰好是乔布斯或者J.K.罗琳才行。

  

Then we speakers are supposed to give you a few minutes of completely garbage advice: Listen to your inner voice. Be true to yourself. Follow your passion. Your future is limitless.

然后我们这种嘉宾就该有模有样得给你们一些烂大街的建议：遵从你的心声呀，做真实的自己呀。追逐自己的激情呀，你的未来无限可能呀之类的。

  

First, my generation gives you a mountain of debt; then we give you career-derailing guidelines that will prevent you from ever paying it off.

事实上，我们这一代人让你欠下一屁股债（即美国国债），然后给你一些绝对会搞砸事业的建议，让你以后连债务都还不清。

That’s why when I’m asked to speak at these things I always try to tell graduates is that since you haven’t graduated from college before you may not know the etiquette. When you get your degree, it’s always nice to tip President Zimmer 10 or 20 bucks just to show he did a good job. It’s also nice to slip the class day speaker a few bills—maybe two or three thousand. Five thousand for the economy majors.

正因如此，轮到我讲这些的时候，我总是试着向毕业生传达，由于你们之前没有经历过大学毕业这事，可能就不知道这里面的套路。当你接过毕业证书时，最好打赏校长齐默10到20美元，等于是为他的工作点个赞。当然最好也能给开放日致辞嘉宾塞些钱——塞个两三千美元什么的。经济系的就给五千吧。

  

On these occasions I also always try to inspire students by telling them about the glittering possibilities in front of them. Within just a few short years many you will be sleeping on your parent’s couches while working for a completely dysfunctional NGO. Others of you will have soul crushing jobs as corporate consultants, working on power points presentations past midnight at the Topeka Comfort Inn.

在这种场合，我通常会试着鼓励一下学子，告诉他们未来一些闪光般的机遇。过不了几年，你们中就会有不少人躺在父母的沙发上呼呼大睡，平时也就是去些办不下去的非政府组织里打打酱油。还有一些会被企业咨询一类的工作磨掉心智，天天为了 PPT 在 Topeka Comfort Inn熬到半夜。（注：Topeka Comfort Inn是那种几十美金一晚的廉价旅店，名字里面带“舒适”，略讽刺）

I’m here to help you navigate these exciting possibilities. I’m here to help you take advantage of the skills you learned at the University of Chicago. You learned how to dominate classroom discussion after having done none of the reading. You learned how to stare at professors with looks of complete rapt attention even though secretly you were completely asleep.

我今天来就是给你们说说该怎么应对这类鸡冻人心的未来。我过来是帮你利用好在芝大学到的技能。你学会了在不做任何阅读的情况下，依然在课堂讨论中称霸一方。你学会了假装全神贯注地盯着台上的教授，实际上你早已昏昏欲睡。

I’m here to urge (you to) lives of public service, working on Capitol Hill for  congressmen, while bringing the nation’s top leaders coffee and sexual tension. I’m here to urge you to serve the world’s poorest people in ways that will look really good on your resume, like organizing an anti-malarial bed net drives while rocking Jimmy Choos at Goldman Sachs. I’m here because, as someone who now teaches at Yale, you should have some sense of what it would have been like if you’d been accepted there.

你们要尽早从政为民，去国会山给众议员工作，给政界高层人物端个咖啡、带来性焦虑。（注：讽刺办公室性骚扰以及指控性骚扰带来的冲突）去帮助那些穷困潦倒之人，让自己的简历看起来漂亮。比如组织个反疟疾蚊帐推广运动什么的，同时自己拎着吉米·周的包包在高盛晃悠。我今天来是因为，由于我现在在耶鲁教书，所以你应该能大概知道如果你去那儿的话，你感受到的氛围是怎样的。

  

But ultimately, I’m not here to give you some standard speech. This is Chicago. This is the only time in my life that I will get to address the graduating class at my own school, at the place that formed me down to my bones.

但话说回来，我来这儿不是为了熬一锅程式化的鸡汤。这里是芝加哥。这是我人生中唯一一次能给我的母校毕业生致辞的机会。芝大给我打上了深深的烙印。

  

I confess I didn’t enjoy every day I spent here. I majored in History and Celibacy. I learned how to walk through campus while awkwardly averting my eyes from anybody I might know. But like all of you, I was changed fundamentally in this place.

说实话，我当时并非每天都很开心。我主修历史也主修禁欲。我学会了如何在穿过校园的同时又假装没看到任何一个我可能认识的人。但和你们一样，芝大彻底改变了我。  

  

The older I get the more I become aware of how it shaped me. I’m 34 years out of college and I feel more influenced by the University of Chicago today than I did on the day I graduated.

随着年岁的增长，我越发体会到芝大对我的影响。我毕业都34年了，可我感觉如今芝大对我的影响甚至比我毕业时还明显。

  

So today I’d really like to talk to you about two things: The things Chicago gave me, which I’ve carried through life, and the things Chicago failed to give me, which I had to learn on my own.

所以今天我想给你们讲两点：芝大教给我让我受用至今的东西，以及它没有教给我从而我必须自己学习的东西。

When I think back on my time here I remember certain moments of great intensity. There was one very odd moment during my first year when I was reading a book called The Death of Tragedy by Nietzsche in a carrel on the A level of the Regenstein.

回想我在芝大念书的时候，我记得有那么几次，我受到了头晕目眩的冲击。我大一时有一次就很奇怪，我在读一本书，书名是《悲剧的死亡》，尼采写的，在芝大雷根斯坦图书馆A层。

  

I don’t know what it was: the driving semi insane power of Nietzsche thought, the overwrought and intoxicating nature of his prose, but somehow while reading that book reality seemed to slip its bounds. I lost all sense of where I was or who I was or how time was passing or whether it was passing at all. Hours flew by and I was just buried inside that book.

我也说不上怎么回事。尼采思想的那种近乎癫狂的驱动力，还有他那仿佛魔力一般能引起情绪起伏的散文。总之，读那本书的时候，虚实之间的界限模糊了。我全然分不清我在哪儿，我是谁，感受不到时间的流逝，觉得时间完全静止。几个小时过去了，我仿佛钻到那本书里。

I was not so much reading it; I was immersed in the torrent of its prose and the fury of its ideas. I was just a sort of dissolved, lifted out of myself, transported, subsumed, and some sort of trance or a state of awed reverence or under a spell cast by a semi crazy long dead mind.

我感觉自己不是在读它，而是被裹在那散文的激流中，猛烈的思想冲刷着我。感觉自己仿佛在溶解，灵魂出了窍，前往别处，被吸收了。朦朦胧胧的，敬仰之情油然而生，好似被一位早就死了的半疯之人施了魔咒。

There I was in a shabby carol on the basement level of the ugliest building on God’s green earth, and I was experiencing something close to transcendence. And when I awoke from that state I looked around startled and blinking, shocked to be re-entering the 20th century, and real life.

当时在地下室，在那栋世界上最丑的楼里，我体验了一把超验的感觉。当我回过神的时候，我懵懵地看着四周，挤弄着眼睛，不敢相信自己还能回到20世纪，回到现实。

  

I never really became a Neitzsche fan, but it was exciting to know that the ideas of some dead genius, could transport me and give me a glimmer of a higher realm. There were other intensities during my time here. There was intense arguing with all my friends about bullshitty subjects at the dining hall hour upon hour. There were intense pseudointellectual debates with graduate students at Jimmys; There was the intensity of serious movie going at Doc Films; and most of all there was a certain intensity in class.

我从未成为尼采真正的粉丝，但振奋人心的是，我知道这些逝去的天才依然能带我一把，去领略一下那更高的殿堂。我在芝大还体会过其他张力十足的时刻。我和朋友们激烈地争论过一些乱七八糟的话题，在食堂里唧唧呱呱几个小时。我和毕业生们装作知识分子一样在吉米酒吧那里争论过。这种时刻还出现在Doc 影院放映着严肃电影时。当然，最激烈的还得算在课堂上。

  

In those days it was pure Great Books for the first two years, and our professors didn’t just teach them, they proselytized them. Some of the old German refugees from World War II were still around then, and they held the belief, with a religious fervor, that the magic keys to the kingdom were in these books. The mysteries of life and how to live well were there for the seizing for those who read well and thought deeply.

那时候，头两年都是存粹地读一些伟大的书籍。而我们的那些教授们不仅仅是教这些书，而是在试图让学生皈依。老师中有一些德国的难民，二战中幸存后依然活着，他们怀着宗教般的热烈，相信通往极乐世界的魔法钥匙就在这些书中。生命的神秘以及美好生活的神性，就在这些书里，等着那些热爱阅读、思考深邃的人来发现。

  

There was a legendary professor named Karl Weintraub teaching Western Civ then. Years later, when he was nearing death he wrote to my classmate Carol Quillen about his experience teaching these books.

当时有位堪称传奇的教授，叫卡尔·温特莱布（注：美国历史学家，自1954年起在芝大任教，同时指导社会理论、文化历史等人文学科方面的研究）教西方文明史。好多年后，他快去世之前，写信给我的同学卡罗·奎林，讲述他教这些书的体验：

  

Teaching Western Civ, Weintraub wrote, “seems to confront me all too often with moments when I feel like screaming suddenly: ‘Oh, God, my dear student, why CANNOT you see that this matter is a real, real matter, often a matter of the very being, for the person, for the historical men and women you are looking at — or are supposed to be looking at!”

温特莱布写道：“教授西方文明史似乎经常把我推到想要尖叫的地步：”噢，天哪，这位同学，你怎么就不明白，这个问题真的，真的很重要，事关一个人之所是，这些你正在学习的历史人物，或者说你应该要去学习的历史人物。

  

I hear the student’s answers and statements that sound like mere words, mere verbal formulations to me, but that do not have the sense of pain or joy or accomplishment or worry about them that they ought to have if they were TRULY informed by the live problems and situations of the human beings back there for whom these matters were real.

我所听到的学生们的答案也好，陈述也好，只是纯粹的词句、空有语言的架子。没有他们该有的心痛、喜悦、成就感和担忧，如果他们打心底意识到这些人类所面对过的问题和境遇如何与生死休戚相关的话，就能真切地感受当时这些问题的重要。

  

The way these disembodied words come forth can make me cry, and the failure of the speaker to probe for the open wounds and such behind the text makes me increasingly furious. “If I do not come to feel any of the love which Pericles feels for his city, how can I understand the Funeral Oration? If I cannot fathom anything of the power of the drive derived from thinking that he has a special mission, what can I understand of Socrates? ...

这些学生们抽象的讨论，常常催我泪下。而谈论它的人要是没能去探寻这些历史伤痕以及文字背后之事的话，就会让我非常愤怒。”如果我未能体会到伯利克利（注：雅典黄金时期（希波战争至伯罗奔尼撒战争）具有重要影响的领导人。他在希波战争后的废墟中重建雅典，扶植文化艺术，现存的很多古希腊建筑都是在他的时代所建）对他所在之城的爱，我又怎能理解那篇《葬礼演说辞》？如果我没有去探究苏格拉底坚信自己身负特殊使命的精神之源，我又如何理解他呢？

  

How can one grasp anything about the problem of the Galatian community without sensing in one’s bones the problem of worrying about God’s acceptance? “Sometimes when I have spent an hour or more, pouring all my enthusiasm and sensitivities into an effort to tell these stories in the fullness in which I see and experience them, I feel drained and exhausted. I think it works on the student, but I do not really know.”

如果一个人压根不担心上帝接不接受你这一问题，又怎么能理解加拉太人面临的处境呢？有时候，我花上一个多小时，拿出我全部的热情和细腻向学生全面地讲述我所体会到的一切，我感到自己被抽空了，精疲力竭。我觉得这对学生有用，但我并不确定。

  

It is a tragedy of teaching that sometimes the professors pour more into the class than the students are able to receive. But in truth that intense teaching is more like planting. Those teachers like Weintraub were inserting seeds that would burst forth years or decades later when the realities of adult life called them forth. I hated Edmund Burke when I read him here but years later he exploded in my mind and has become one of the great guides of my life. I was blandly indifferent to Augustine when I encountered him, it was only later that I understood the power of his loves and his wrestling with his own soul, and the need to be careful about what you love, because you become what you love.

教学的一个悲剧就是，有时候教授们在课堂上倾注的远多于学生能吸收的。但实际上，这种高强度的教学更像是在树人。像温特莱布这样的老师，是在播种，等到几年甚至几十年后，成年生活中的种种现实会浇灌这些种子，令其茁壮生长。我在芝大读埃德蒙·伯克时，我很反感他。但多年后，他又重回我的脑海，并成为了我生活中的一位重要向导。我初读奥古斯汀时，提不起什么兴致，直到后来我才理解了他那爱与灵魂挣扎之中蕴含的力量，明白了要谨慎得对待我之所爱，因为它会成为我之所是。

Chicago gave me glimpses of the mountain ranges of human existences. It gave me a set of longings, higher longings than any I had had. In the first place, I longed to know how to see. Seeing reality seems like a straightforward thing. You just look out and see the world. But anybody who is around politics or many other arenas knows how many people see the world with a distorting mirror, how many see only what they want to see, or what they can see by the filtering light of their depression, fear, insecurity or narcissism.

芝大让我领略了人类文明的崇山峻岭。它点燃了我内心的诸多渴望，我从未有过的更高层次的渴望。首先，我渴望看见。看见现实似乎是再明显不过的一件事，只需要睁开眼，就能看到这个世界。但是关切政治讨论以及其他领域的人都清楚，有太多人带着扭曲的视角看世界，有太多人只想看到他们想看到的，或者，只能看到由他们压抑、恐惧、不安全或是自恋的滤镜处理过的世界。

  

Sometimes I think the whole disaster of the Trump presidency is because of a breakdown of intellectual virtue. A break down in America’s ability to face evidence clearly, to pay due respect to the concrete contours of reality. These intellectual virtues may seem elitist, but once a country tolerates dishonesty, incuriosity and intellectual laziness, then everything else falls apart.

有时候我觉得，特朗普当选总统的噩梦，正反映了求知美德崩坏的现实。美国人实事求是的能力崩坏了，没有给事实的清晰轮廓以足够尊重。这些求知的美德或许显得有些精英主义，但一旦一个国家开始容忍欺瞒、无知、懒于探索，那就必将礼崩乐坏。

  

John Ruskin once wrote, “The more I think of it I find this conclusion more impressed upon me— that the greatest thing a human soul ever does is to see something, and tell what is saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see.” At Chicago, I encountered so many writers who could see so purely and carefully --Shakespeare, Hume, Socrates and George Eliot, George Orwell and Hannah Arendt. I met so many professors and students who could weigh evidence and who didn’t tolerate intellectual shabbiness. It aroused in me a desire to have that virtue—the ability to see clearly and face unpleasant facts.

约翰·拉斯金曾写到：“我越是深入地思考，我就越倾向于得出这个结论——人类所能做的最了不起之事就是，看到了什么，便如实地说出来。千百人口说不如一人思索，千万人思索不如一人见过。”在芝大，我邂逅许许多多目光澄澈又细腻的作家：莎士比亚、休谟、苏格拉底、乔治·艾略特、乔治·奥威尔还有汉娜·阿伦特。我见过许许多多注重实证、不容马虎求知的教授和学生。这让我也渴望具备此种品质——懂得观看之道，直面不快的现实。

Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see.” At Chicago, I encountered so many writers who could see so purely and carefully --Shakespeare, Hume, Socrates and George Eliot, George Orwell and Hannah Arendt. I met so many professors and students who could weigh evidence and who didn’t tolerate intellectual shabbiness. It aroused in me a desire to have that virtue—the ability to see clearly and face unpleasant facts.

约翰·拉斯金曾写到：“我越是深入地思考，我就越倾向于得出这个结论——人类所能做的最了不起之事就是，看到了什么，便如实地说出来。千百人口说不如一人思索，千万人思索不如一人见过。”在芝大，我邂逅许许多多目光澄澈又细腻的作家：莎士比亚、休谟、苏格拉底、乔治·艾略特、乔治·奥威尔还有汉娜·阿伦特。我见过许许多多注重实证、不容马虎求知的教授和学生。这让我也渴望具备此种品质——懂得观看之道，直面不快的现实。
